Usage: qa-DKRZ options

  Quality Assurance of file system based ${PROJECT} experiments.

  QA for file system (FS) based data of climatological experiments
  contained in netCDF files.
  The QA builds directories for storage of check-log files, session
  annotations and time series (netCDF) of QA specific data. The
  latter is given in a directory tree similar to the one of the original
  data, i.e. arranged for variables and the corresponding frequency.
  The logfiles for checked experiments are stored within directory
  'check_logs', which contain sub-dirs _Notes and _Periods for
  annotations of failed checks and checked time-range, respectively.
  Please, have a look at QA-DKRZ/doc/qa-user-manual.pdf for more details.

  A run is usually started by executing:
     path/QA-DKRZ/scripts/qa-DKRZ options
  where options contain usually -c 'file' and/or -f 'file' for
  one or two configuration files.
  A configuration file with processing directives may contain a link
  to another configuration file with lower priority; there is no
  maximal nesting depth.

  Assignments on the command-line may overwrite those of
  the configuration file. However, most of command-line options
  are for short-term purposes (debugging, displaying status etc.).
  Usage of configuration file(s) is recommended.
  Each configuration assignment may be given on the command-line, but
  prefixed by '-E_'.

  Regular Expressions are permitted as applicable to the 'expr' command.
  Definition: A list is comma-separated in a single string.

  Usually key-words will be given only once, but are overruled
  corresponding to the priority of configuration files; but
  assignments could be appended by '+='.

  Assignments ot key words SELECT and LOCK exhibit identical,
  but specific behaviour. The assignment character '=' is replaced
  by a space. However, continuation of assignments (appending) is
  done with '+=*. SELECT and LOCK, respectively, may be substituted
  by -S and -L on the command-line.
  Syntax: [path1[,path2,...]]=[var1[,var2,...]]
  Examples ('path' denotes a sub-path continuing the
  one in PROJECT/DATA, 'var' inidcates a starting sub-string for
  file names [e.g. tas_.*day]):
  1) path=var
     specifies a path where to look for a single variable; the path
     may fork to and continue with several sub-paths (e.g. for frequencies).
  2) p1,p2=var
     two paths to look for a variable.
  3) a) p1=
     b) p1,p2=
     one and two paths, respectively, with every variable;
     equivalent to p1,p2=.*
  4) p1=v1,v2
     one path [in the sense of 1)] with two variables.
  5) var[,v2,v3]
     specified variables in every path.
  6) p1=,p2=v1...  --> This is an ERROR.
  7) no '=' character
     a) not a path: variable(s) in all sub-paths prolonging the one
        in PROJECT_DATA, equivalent to '.*', e.g.
        by -S var on the command-line.
     b) contains at least a single '/' character; this is
        equivalent to 3a).

  But, if you want to make a run only for a specific variable
  or a group of entries using Regular Expression, then using
  the command-line is reasonable. Also some features are only
  enabled via the command-line, e.g. -E_DEBUG_... .

  Options:
   -E_OPT[=val]    Enable where OPT indicates a configuration directive.
             A key-word without assignments is a boolean switches set True.
             E_OPT is case-insensitiv. Detailed description is given in file
             QA-DKRZ/example/CORDEX_qa.conf; '_' may be replaced by a blank
             or omitted at all.
   -f name   Read configuration.
             Note: one configuration file may contain frequently
             modified assignments while the other hold all time
             assignments. If a name without leading path component
             is not available locally, then QA-DKRZ/tables is searched.
             Note: files for -c and -f are arbitrarily convertible.
   -h/--help This description.
   -L        Locking of paths and variables
   -m        Display a status line below the command-line call.
   -P        Project name (usually PROJECT= in a config-file).
   -S        Selection of paths and variables (see config-file).
   -x        Equivalent to -E_DEBUG_C -E_DEBUG_E -E_DEBUG_M.
   --auto-up[=disable]
             Permanently enable/disable automatic updates [default: disable].
             Disable a previously enabled option: --auto-up=d[isable].
   --conda-update  Update the qa-dkrz package by conda.
   --config-file-location[=path]
             The user's HOME directory by default; abbreviation --lcf.
   --debug   Show bash execution commands of install, qa-config, qa-dkrz, qa-dkrz
   --example Run the example.
   --force-update
             Update tables; by default this is done during the first run of
             the current day.
   --home=/path
             Path to the .qa-dkrz directory [default: user's home]. Also the
             location where external tables are copied and updated as well where
             users may define their permanent modification of tables.
             Equivalent to option QA_HOME.
   --ignore_failed_update
   --install[=PROJECT-name]
             Use qa-dkrz call as a wrapper to the install script and then exit.
             Project-name is only used for compiling the C++ programs; may be omitted
             when a PROJECT or a PROJECT_AS name is specified.
   --lcf     --config-file-location
   --no-internet   Usage in off-line mode.
   --pb[=filename[,step]]
             Progress bar properties. (obsolete)
             Output of number of processed data files and total number of data files;
             if a filename is not provided, then to stdout. Note that stdout should be
             redirected if option -m is also active. The step defines the stepping rate
             of the output in terms of percentage; 1% by default.
             Note that a filename must contain at least a single alpha char and
             that the step must not ... .
   --project_as=string
             The current PROJECT is treated as PROJECT_AS=string, but with
             the name kept.
   --set-default-project=PROJECT
             If the installation is done from GitHub, then the command QA-DKRZ/install
             without assignment of a project name, then the binary is compiled
             for CORDEX. This option changes the default permanently .
             Not for the installation by conda.
   --work    Location of check results. Usually set by option QA_RESULTS.
             However for running the example, then also the HOME for .qa-dkrz
             and tables.

             Note that the script QA-DKRZ/install provides some more build-specific
             options (only for installation from GitHub).
